        <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
        <p class="Security-txt">I started my professional career at IBM as a system administrator, but I quickly found myself
          in Business Controls and then into Managed Security at IBM where I built and managed new security services. I have spent 19 years of my career
          in security as a Service Lead, Global Security Program Manager, Architect, and Compliance Officer.</p>

        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p class="programming-txt">I graduated from college with a Batchelor of Science in Computer Science in 1999. I did not use my Computer Science
          degree for development for a long time at IBM until I moved into a Development business unit for Watson Health in 2015. I love this skill and have spent
          a lot of my personal development time keeping these skills up to date, including a 2 week development bootcamp in 2020. This website main purpose
          was to continue these skills of front and back end development and show some of the projects I am completing today.</p>

        <h3>Risk and Compliance</h3>
        <p class="Security-txt">Many of the roles I have been part of at IBM contained both Security and Compliance, as well as roles that only focused on Risk
          and Compliance. In 2015 I was the Cloud Compliance officer for the IBM HIPPA Porgram office and built and designed many of the controls that would follow
          how IBM would meet our regulatory compliance needs in IBM Cloud. Today I work in Enterprise and Technology Security looking at our internal delivery and
          standards around both Security and compliance.</p>

        <h3>Cloud Architecture</h3>
        <p class="programming-txt">I have been a Executive Level Security Architect for IBM the past 5 years, with a deep knowledge of IBM Cloud architecture and
          practices, I also wanted to expand my knowlege of other clouds and frameworks. I have personal experence creating apps in AWS as well. The second main
